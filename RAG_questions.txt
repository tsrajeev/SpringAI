 Based on the WEF Future of Jobs Report 2025 PDF in your project, here are some thoughtful questions to ask the RAG system:

  1. What are the top skills employers will prioritize by 2027?
  2. How is AI expected to impact job displacement versus creation?
  3. What percentage of companies plan to adopt AI technologies by 2027?
  4. Which industries are expected to see the most growth in the next few years?
  5. What are the main barriers to technology adoption identified in the report?
  6. How are remote work patterns expected to evolve?
  7. What workforce strategies are companies implementing to address skills gaps?
  8. Which emerging technologies will have the greatest impact on business growth?
  9. What reskilling and upskilling initiatives are recommended in the report?
  10. How do projections differ between developed and developing economies?

  These questions target different aspects of the report and should demonstrate your RAG system's ability to extract and synthesize
  relevant information.
